# HTTP RESPONCE STATUS CODES.

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

These codes are grouped in five classes.

1. Information responces (100 - 199)
2. Successful responses (200 - 299)
3. Redirection messages. (300 - 399)
4. Client error responses. (400 - 499)
5. Server error responses. (500 - 599).

## A). Information responses.

| `421 - Misdirected Request.`             | - The server receiving the request can't generate a response because it's not set up to handle the type of request it received.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `422 - Unprocessable Content.`           | - The request was well-informed but was unable to be followed due to semantic erros.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `423 - Locked.`                          | - The resource that is being accessed is locked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `424 - Failed Dependency.`               | - The request failed due to failure of a previous request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `425 - Too Early.`                       | - Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `426 - Upgrade Required.`                | - The server cannot process the request with the current protocol but might do so if the client upgrades to a different protocol. The server specifies the required protocol(s) in an Upgrade header in the response.                                                                        |
| `428 - Precondition Required.`           | - The server needs the request to include certain conditions to prevent conflicts. This is to avoid a situation where a client retrieves a resource, makes changes to it, and sends it back, unaware that another party has already modified the resource on the server, causing a conflict. |
| `429 - Too Many Requests.`               | - The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time('Rate limiting.)                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `431 - Request Header Fields Too Large.` | -The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `451 - Unavailable for legal reasons.`   | - The user agent requested a resource that cannot legally be provided, such as a web page censored by a government.                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `500 - Internal Server Error.`           | - The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `501 - Not Implemented.`                 | - The server cannot process the request method used. Servers are only required to support GET and HEAD methods and should not return this code for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `502 - Bad Gateway.`                     | -This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `503 - Service Unavailable.`             | - The server can't handle the request right now. This could be because it's down for maintenance or overloaded. When sending this response, a user-friendly page explaining the issue should accompany it. It's meant for temporary situations, and the Retry-After header can indicate when the service might be available again. Caching-related headers should be managed carefully to avoid caching this temporary response. |
| `504 - Gateway Timeout.`                 | - This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `505 - HTTP Version Not Supported.`      | -The HTTP version used in the request is not supported by the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `506 - Variant Also Negotiates.`         | - The server has a configuration issue. The resource requested is set up to handle content negotiation on its own, so it can't serve as the final endpoint in the negotiation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `507 - Insufficient Storage.`            | - The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `508 - Loop Detected.`                   | - The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ` 510 - Not Extended.`                   | - Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfill it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `511 - Network Authentication Required.` | - Indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
